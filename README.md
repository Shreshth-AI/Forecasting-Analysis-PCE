**Project Description:**

**Forecasting U.S. Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE)**

• Which forecasting model (Simple Forecasting, Exponential Smoothing, ARIMA) provides the most accurate prediction for PCE trends?

• How do data cleaning, missing value imputation, and trend analysis impact forecasting accuracy?

• What is the best model for predicting PCE in October 2024, and how does it compare to real trends?

• How does one-step ahead rolling forecasting enhance model reliability and performance?

**Analysis:**

This study evaluates U.S. Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) using Drift Method, Holt’s Exponential Smoothing, and Auto ARIMA to identify the best forecasting model. After data preprocessing and trend analysis, model accuracy was assessed using RMSE and MAE metrics. Results show Holt’s Exponential Smoothing as the most reliable model for predicting future consumption trends, supporting economic forecasting and decision-making.
